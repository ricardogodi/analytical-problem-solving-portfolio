# Analytical Problem-Solving Portfolio

Welcome to my Analytical Problem-Solving Portfolio. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to tackling challenging LeetCode problems, aligned with the NeetCode roadmap for problem-solving. Here, you will find detailed solutions, accompanied by diagrams and explanations of the underlying logic, processes, and mechanisms.

## Description

This portfolio is designed to help understand and solve complex programming problems. I try to provide clear explanations and visual aids to enhance understanding. The focus is on the development of strong problem-solving skills through rigorous and analytical approaches.

## Current Progress

This project is a work in progress. I am continuously working on new problems and updating this repository. My goal is to cover all the problems in the NeetCode roadmap. Here is the progress so far:

- **Arrays and Hashing**
- **Two Pointers**
- **Stack**

## Future Coverage

The repository will eventually cover all problem categories from the NeetCode roadmap, including but not limited to:

- Sliding Window
- Binary Search
- Linked List
- Trees
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs
- And many more...
